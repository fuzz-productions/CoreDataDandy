	/// dandy (relationships to)
	///							-> hats
	///							-> gossip	(relationship to)
	///														->	purveyor

	/// into json.
	/// - If ["hats", "gossip"] is specified when serializing the dandy object, Dandy's attributes will be serialize
	/// along with its hats and gossipe relationships.
	/// - If ["gossip.purveyor"] is specified when serializing the dandy object, Dandy's attributes, gossip, and 
	/// gossip's purveyor will be serialized into json.
	///
	/// Note: attributes with nil values will not be included in the returned json. However, nil relationships that are 
	/// specified will be included as empty arrays or objects.
	///
	/// - parameter object: An object to serialize into json
	/// - parameter relationships: Relationships and keypaths to nested relationships targeted for serialization.
	///
	/// - returns: A json representation of this object and its relationships if one could be produced. Otherwise, nil.
